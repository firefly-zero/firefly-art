# firefly-art

This is the collection of art (and guidelines for using it) that we use on Firefly Zero websites, documentation, t-shirts, stickers, etc. Most of it revolves around Lux, our mascot.

Most of the art here is created by [Alena Ponomareva](https://www.instagram.com/alpo.nl/), a talented artist from Netherlands.
